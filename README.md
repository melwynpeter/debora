# Debora – AI-Powered Personal Assistant App (Final Year Project)

**Debora** is a smart, voice-enabled personal assistant Android app developed as part of my final year Bachelor's project. It uses **custom speech recognition**, **Gemini (GPT-based AI)** for intelligent responses, and **Firebase** for real-time data management. Debora helps users manage tasks, stay organized, and interact with AI in a personalized way — all through natural voice commands.
